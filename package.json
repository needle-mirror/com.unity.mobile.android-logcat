    "changelog": "### Fixes & Improvements\n - Logcat package now detects if the logs with a specific tag are disabled on a device (this was causing messages not to be displayed), and if so, displays a message with an option to fix such behavior.\n - Fixed an issue with MemoryWindow, where active package would get lost during domain reload.\n - Improved internal log to handle a large amount of messages.\n - Fixed an issue where logcat dispatcher would stop responding during domain reload.\n - Fixed an issue where MemoryWindow would fail to query memory stats using package name. It now uses process id instead.\n - Added Process Manager control which you can use to terminate an application or send a trim memory event.\n - Fixed tag filtering, previously logcat would check if incoming_tag contains tag_in_filter, now it will perform incoming_tag equals tag_in_filter. That way it's easier to filter messages with tags which have the same begining."
